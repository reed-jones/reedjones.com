I built myself a cabin, spent six months living in Nicaragua learning how to surf, tree planted for 5 seasons and help build the World Cup Alpine Downhill Ski Race course in Lake Louise, Alberta.</p><p><a href="https://www.valleymuseumarchives.ca/"><img src="img/vmas.jpg" id="vmasImg"></a> I am full stack developer with experience in various backend technologies including PHP and Node.JS, various Databases including MYSQL, PostgreSQL, and T-SQL, and frontend technologies such as HTML5 / CSS3 / Javascript / JQuery.
